# SmartExcel Plugin

SmartExcel Plugin is an open-source browser extension that detects HTML tables on web pages and exports them to Excel-compatible files.

It is designed as the browser-extension companion to the SmartExcel website. The extension can work as a table export tool, and it also integrates with the website for plugin login, credit balance, payment entry, and credit synchronization.

## What It Does

- Detects HTML tables on any web page.
- Shows a floating SmartExcel export button when the user hovers over a table.
- Exports a single table as `.xlsx` or `.csv`.
- Exports all detected tables from the popup.
- Preserves table headers and structured cell data where possible.
- Checks login, free quota, and credit balance before paid export flows.
- Opens the SmartExcel website for login, registration, and credit purchase flows.
- Syncs plugin authentication and credit state from the website.
- Displays the popup language from the user's browser region by default, with manual language switching in settings.

## Project Roles

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `entrypoints/background.ts` | Runtime coordinator for login state, credits, free limits, payment redirects, context-menu actions, and extension messages. |
| `entrypoints/content.tsx` | Content script that runs on web pages, detects tables, handles page-level export actions, and mounts the floating table overlay. |
| `entrypoints/popup/App.tsx` | Main popup panel that lists detected tables, displays account or credit state, and starts export/login/payment actions. |
| `entrypoints/popup/SettingsPanel.tsx` | Popup settings screen for language, account state, login, registration, and logout controls. |
| `components/TableOverlay.tsx` | Floating in-page SmartExcel button and export menu shown next to hovered tables. |
| `utils/table-parser.ts` | HTML table detection and parsing logic. |
| `utils/excel-export.ts` | SheetJS-based file generation for Excel and CSV exports. |
| `utils/messaging.ts` | Message contract types shared by popup, content script, and background worker. |
| `utils/store.ts` | Zustand state for extension UI settings such as enabled state and language. |
| `utils/i18n.ts` | Chinese/English translations and region-aware default language detection. |
| `utils/extension-runtime.ts` | Safe runtime helpers for extension-context checks and messaging. |
| `utils/ensure-content-script.ts` | Helper used by the popup to make sure the active tab can receive content-script messages. |
| `tailwind.config.ts` | Extension theme tokens aligned with the SmartExcel website visual style. |
| `wxt.config.ts` | WXT extension configuration, manifest metadata, permissions, and browser build setup. |

## Design Direction

The extension UI follows the SmartExcel website style:

- warm off-white surfaces;
- green SmartExcel brand accents;
- soft borders and shadows;
- compact shadcn-style controls;
- simple lucide icons;
- restrained motion and hover states.

## Language Behavior

The popup and overlay support Chinese and English.

By default, the extension detects the user's browser locale and regional hints. Chinese-speaking locales and common Chinese-region time zones show Chinese. Other regions fall back to English. Users can override the language in the popup settings panel.

## Development

Use `npm` in this repository.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Browser-specific development:

```bash
npm run dev:edge
npm run dev:firefox
```

## Build

```bash
# Chrome MV3 build
npm run build

# Edge MV3 build
npm run build:edge

# Firefox build
npm run build:firefox

# All browser builds
npm run build:all
```

Build outputs are written to `.output/`.

For real QA, load the unpacked extension from `.output/chrome-mv3/` or `.output/edge-mv3/` and test on pages with real HTML tables.

## Release Archives

```bash
npm run zip
npm run zip:edge
npm run zip:firefox

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Please keep changes focused and run the relevant build command before opening a PR.

For changes involving plugin credits, login redirects, payment entry, or website sync, validate the sibling SmartExcel website repo as well because those flows depend on both projects.
